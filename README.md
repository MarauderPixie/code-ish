# Some sensible way to count days, at last!

To all ye' faithful fellows and fellowstresses of the *Paratheo-Anametamystikhood of Eris Esoteric*, be no longer dreaded for not having convenient tools to count your limited days in a sufficiently discordian fashion in **R**, because Pope Pixie got you covered!



# PERPETUAL DATE CONVERTER FROM GREGORIAN TO POEE CALENDAR

All you need to do is

```
devtools::install_github("MarauderPixie/ddateR")
```

after which you can just run `ddate()`. Remember to use with caution. If anything goes wrong, well, good luck to you. In case of inadequate behavior, don't worry, just keep going. God speed to you, tread lightly.
